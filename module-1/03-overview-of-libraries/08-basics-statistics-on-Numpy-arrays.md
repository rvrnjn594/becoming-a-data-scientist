## Basic statistics

#### np.mean

It computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis of the numpy array. It takes in an axis parameter.

- If the axis is not specified, it returns the mean of the flattened version of the array.
- If the axis is specified as zero, it returns the mean across each column.
- If the axis is specified as one, it returns the mean across each row.

#### np.std

It computes the standard deviation along the specified axis of the numpy array. It takes in an axis parameter.

- If the axis is not specified, it returns the mean of the flattened version of the array.
- If the axis is specified as zero, it returns the mean across each column.
- If the axis is specified as one, it returns the mean across each row.

#### np.var

It computes the variance along the specified axis of the Numpy array. It takes in an axis parameter.

- If the axis is not specified, it returns the mean of the flattened version of the array.
- If the axis is specified as zero, it returns the mean across each column.
- If the axis is specified as one, it returns the mean across each row.
