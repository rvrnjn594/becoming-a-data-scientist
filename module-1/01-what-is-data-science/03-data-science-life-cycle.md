# Data Science Life Cycle

The life cycle involves problem understanding, data acquistion, data wragling, data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, and monitoring.

The Data Science life cycle involves the following steps:

1. Problem Understanding  
   It all starts with understanding the problem at hand, the questions, and the answers we are trying to find from the dataset at hand.
2. Data Acquisition  
   As the name suggests, is about retrieving the data with the help of Data Engineers where required.  
   It also consolidates all of the data required to answer the question or to solve the problem at hand.
3. Data Wragling  
   Data wrangling is about using knowledge to preprocess data. It involves looking for missing values and asking business questions like why they are missing.  
   Furthermore, it uses knowledge to give shape to the dataset appropriate for visulizations and to support the coming steps in the life cycle.
4. Data Exploration  
   Data exploration is about visualization and other statistics' measures to see whether the questions we asked, in the beginning, are being answered or not?  
    The data analyst's job ends here.
5. Feature Engineering and Selection  
   It is a preprocessing step before modelling in both Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  
    We will look inti these fields in the coming sections. It has similar steps to Data Wragling apart from some algorithms for Feature Selection and transformation.
6. Modelling  
   Modelling is the process that uncovers the meaning of the data. It is about capturing underlying trends and the data's behavior to make the model, which can be used for predictive analytics as described in the previous section.
7. Deployment  
   After we build the model we'll deploy it in the most efficient and optimized manner so that real-world people can use it. It can be deployed on mobile applications and web applications.
8. Monitoring  
   After we have deployed the model, we will want to monitor it. Monitoring is about familiarizing the model with the new dataset and tracking the number of requests that model receives.  
    It also involves making changes to the analysis and starting over if required.
