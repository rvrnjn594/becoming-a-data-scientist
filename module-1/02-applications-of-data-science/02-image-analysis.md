# Image Analysis

Learn about Data Science and Image Analysis. Data Science specifically computer vision with deep learning, is being used extensively in image analysis for surveillance, image classification, object detection, object tracking, segmentation, self-driving cars and many more.

Among the most common types of data available out there are Image and Video data.  
We can apply computer vision and Deep Learning in Data Science for the betterment of society.

Some applicaions are listed below.

1. Image classification
   Image classification refers to classifying an image into one of the categories on which a model is trained.  
   Massive work has been done on image classification, and models inspired by the working of the brain are being used to do this task.
2. Object detection
   Object detection refers to drawing a bounding box around an object in an image.  
   It also displays its class.
3. Object segmentation
   Object segmentation refers to classifying an image at the pixel level and marking all the pixels belonging to one object and so on.
4. Object tracking
   Object tracking refers to tracking an object in a video and displaying the bounding box around it.
5. Self-driving cars
   You might have heard of this. Yes, the images being captured by the self-driving car are being processed by Data Science algorithms, and then decisions are made based on them.
6. Image translation
   Algorithms and models in Data Science are also used in image translation.  
    For example, translating images of one species of animals to others and so on.
