# Applications in Healthcare and Recommender Systems

Learn about how drug discovery, predictive medicine, medical imaging, genomics, and recommender systems utilize data science.

## Drug discovery

Data science is used extensively in drug discovery. The composition of drugs is checked against certain bacteria, and their results are compiled and studied in digital form, which wasn't possible a decade ago.  
 Ever since pharmacists discovered Data Science, they have used its power, and many new drugs are emerging as a result.

## Predictive medicine

Nowadays, healthcare professionals use many wearables to track the blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar level of patients.  
 This data is generated and processed in real-time. Based on the body's current health data, the system can trigger an alarm that indicates something bad is about to happen to the patient.

This was impossible in the past. This can save more lives.

## Medical imaging

Data Science is also being used extensively in medical imaging.  
X-rays, ultrasounds, and MRI scans use Data Science to diagnose possible issues in patients.  
 The amazing thing is that computer vision (a part of Data Science) tools can detect cancer in the corresponding scans and are outperforming the physicians.  
 Those systems and other issues are being deployed onto real time devices and are being made accessible to people where there is a shortage of doctors.

## Genomics

In genomics, we apply Data Science to understand the underlying sequence of the genome and try to understand its secret patterns, which are involved in the function of different parts of human body.

## Data Science for recommender systems

Data Science also plays a key role in Information Retrieval. Whenever a user buys a product from a certain site like Amazon or Alibaba, they start seeing some ads or items that are related to the product.  
 In the same way, a user may get recommendations while they purchase items. The user's purchasing history is stored at the company's server, and the company is utilizing Data Science to predict which items the user is likely to buy next.  
 This technique is being used on many sites to increase the site's traffic and enhance product sales.
