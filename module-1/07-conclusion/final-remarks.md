# Final Remarks

Here's a quick summary of what we learned from the "Getting Started with Data Science" module.

## Summary

- We started with the introduction of data science and its states.
- Then, we went through applications of data science in healthcare and image analysis.
- After that, we got an overview of a few most common libraries, such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, NumPy, spaCy, seaborn etc.
- We learned how to do data manipulation with NumPy, and data analysis with pandas.
- In the end, we went through important concepts of probablity and statistics.

## What's next?

Now that we have familiarized ourselves with some of the basic concepts of data science, we'll learn about the related field, machine learning, in the next module, "An introductory guide to Machine Learning."
