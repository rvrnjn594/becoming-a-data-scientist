# Final Remarks

Here's a quick summary of what we learned from the "An Introductory Guide to Machine Learning" module.

## Summary

This module was divided into three parts.

- In the first part, we started with the introduction of machine learning and then learned about regression, feature scaling, and a few methods such as filter, wrapper, and intrinsic.
- In the second part, we dive deep into the classification and its types, naive Bayes, model evaluation, and hyper-parameter optimization.
- In the last part, we went through unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms.
- We also discovered details about big data and its tools.

## What's next?

Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the basic and advanced level concepts of machine learning, we'll learn about deep learning in the next module, "Data Science with scikit-learn."
